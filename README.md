The first task was tested in MySQL and SQLite3.
The second task needs installed python (at least version 3.6) and the haversine python package. To do it just type "pip install -r requirements.txt". To run the script you need to type command as "python3 second_task.py --from Stambul --to Moscow Minsk Paris". Youc can change Stambul, Moscow, Minsk and Paris to another city names, and you'll get the best flight information.
